## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is best suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, where frequent feedback and adjustments are needed, and where the project benefits from iterative development and close collaboration with stakeholders.

Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear, linear path, where changes are minimal, and where detailed documentation and predictability are important.

Advantages of agile
-Agile allows for changes in requirements even late in the development process, accommodating evolving needs and priorities.
-Regular reviews and demonstrations ensure that the product aligns with customer expectations and can be adjusted based on feedback.

Disadvantages
-Continuous changes in requirements can lead to scope creep and affect project timelines and budgets
-Regular meetings, reviews, and updates can be time-consuming and require significant coordination.

Advantages of waterfall
-The linear progression provides a clear structure and defined milestones, making it easier to manage and track progress.
-it’s easier to estimate timelines, budgets, and resource needs.

Disadvantages
-Changes to requirements or scope can be difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway.
-Since testing occurs after development, there is a risk that the final product may not fully align with user needs or expectations.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
when Agile is more beneficial?
Projects with Evolving Requirements
Description: Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently or where the scope is not well-defined at the start.
Example: A software startup developing a new mobile app. The app’s features and user needs may evolve based on user feedback, market trends, and competition. Agile allows for iterative development and regular updates based on real user input.

when Waterfall is more beneficial?
Projects with Well-Defined Requirements
Description: Waterfall is ideal for projects where requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change significantly.
Example: Developing a regulatory compliance system for a government agency where requirements are strictly defined and change is minimal. Waterfall’s structured approach ensures all requirements are met without frequent adjustments.

Therefore;
Agile is well-suited for projects with evolving requirements, high customer interaction, and a need for flexibility and rapid iteration. Examples include mobile app development and custom software solutions with dynamic requirements.

Waterfall is more appropriate for projects with fixed requirements, clear scope, and a need for detailed documentation and sequential execution. Examples include regulatory compliance systems and large-scale infrastructure projects.
